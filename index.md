<p>Welcome to my profile</p>

My name is Jesus Guillen. I am a 5th year finishing up my Majors in Statistics and Economics. I am interested in data visualization and plan on learning tableau and hadoop over the next few weeks. Additionally, I am interested in reading research papers in the field of statistics to see what innovations may be worth learning. For example, I recently read a paper suggesting that you could create a model with predictors that are not statistically significant, but do better at prediction than variables that are statistically significant.

Another paper I am reading is one on mutual information:

In this portfolio I plan on uploading stat projects in addition to research I am doing on the WASH benefits study.

For example here is one of my previous HW assignments:

I am very fortunate to be participating in the WASH Benefits Study program here in UC DAVIS. More information regarding the study can be found at: http://www.washbenefits.net/

The overall goal is to measure the benefits of water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and nutritional interventions to improve child health and development. I have only joined the project recently. At the moment I am assisting with cleaning up the data manually. There are excel files and paper surveys for each of the children present in the study. However, there are many discrepencies between the survey and excel files, which need to be edited on the excel file before the data can be manipulated. For my 141B project I decided to work on my own on some surveys I was not required to be working on. However a lot of my time was spent cleaning this specific surveys as there are thousands of lines that can not be easily fixed using methods such as text analyzation or regular expression. 

I created the Asset Index using PCA in STATA and relabeled the excel files using STATA as well.
